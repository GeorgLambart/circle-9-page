    <h2>3. Provision of the Website and Creation of Server Log Files</h2>

      <strong>Storage Duration</strong>: The data is stored for a maximum of 7
      days and then deleted, unless security-relevant events (e.g., attacks)
      require longer retention.<br />

      whom a data processing agreement pursuant to Art. 28 GDPR has been
      concluded.

      or pre-contractual measures) and Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR (legitimate interest in
      communication).<br />
      <strong>Storage Duration</strong>: The data is stored for 6 months and
      then deleted, unless legal retention obligations (e.g., tax-related)
